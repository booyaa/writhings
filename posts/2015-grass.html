<span style="background-color:#2b303b;color:#c0c5ce;">Green grass, quivering dandelions, and daisies. Blades of grass shiver. As the days of spring come to an end. The riotous chatter of the birds in their trees. The swoosh of cars heading to work. The odd reversing klaxon. The birds wonder through the park surveying their domain.
