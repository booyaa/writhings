```
code is poetry 
a phrase coined by automattic
those clever folk who made wordpress

code is poetry
for when i’m in the zone and 
the how and wow comes naturally

code is poetry
when you crack that tough bug
and wipe the smug grin off it’s face

code is poetry
when some thanks you for your useful app
when you thought it was crap

code is poetry
yet my only regret
is not being a developer from day one
```
