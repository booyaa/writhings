I found you discarded on my path

the sight of you was distressful when I noticed you were in half

I wonder how you came to be

a half eaten snack of a wylie fox

did you fight to the end defending your pups?

or where surprise attack for a spot of lunch?

yet here you are discarded on my path

half a hedgehog 

half a laugh?
